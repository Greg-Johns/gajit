## About Time
<time>Nov. 9th, 2021</time>

While working in Verizon's R&D lab's I had some *time* to think about *time*. Not just as it pertains to the users experience but also as a function of the system itself, like a clock interface. This helps you think about all sorts of things as potential interfaces to measures *time*.

One of the more interesting ideas I had from this prolonged thinking on *time* and interaction led to what I called TimeWinder. This was a proposed idea for an application that would let the user interact with his/her schedule on their smart phone in a quick and intuitive way.

Verizon liked the idea and patented it. But alas, the *time* was not right, priorities change and the idea was never implemented.
